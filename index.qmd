Hi there! I'm Joshua. As a current MEDS student at The Bren (UCSB), I have many interests including **conservation, restoration, environmental justice, and energy**. I passionately believe the road to an equitable environmental future is **research that is collaborative and transparent**. Outside of work, I enjoy **backcountry winter camping** (I know, brrr), traveling, and going on adventures with my Great Dane named Ziggy. Check out my website and learn more about me and my work!
