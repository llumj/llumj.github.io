### Maine's Marvels: Discovering the Pine Tree State
Maine, often known as the Pine Tree State, is a treasure trove of natural beauty and is the place I spent many summers as a kid. From its rugged coastline dotted with iconic lighthouses to its vast forests and pristine lakes, Maine offers a breathtaking landscape for outdoor enthusiasts. The state is home to Acadia National Park, where visitors can hike granite peaks, explore rocky shores, and witness stunning sunrises from Cadillac Mountain. Maine is also famous for its delicious seafood, particularly its succulent lobster, which has become a symbol of the state's culinary heritage. Quaint coastal towns, vibrant fall foliage, and a rich maritime history make Maine a captivating destination for travelers and nature lovers alike.

### Maine, A Changing Climate 
In a world where the effects of climate change are becoming increasingly evident, Maine has not been immune to its impacts. Over the past century, the state known for its beautiful autumn colors, rocky coast and snowy winters, has experienced a significant shift in its climate. Changes that include average yearly temperatures rising by 3.5 degrees (F) and annual precipitation increasing by 6 inches. These climatic changes have brought about a range of environmental consequences, one of which is the proliferation of ticks. As Maine's climate becomes warmer and wetter, the conditions become more favorable for ticks to thrive, posing new challenges for both public health and the natural ecosystem.

While ticks may seem like tiny, insignificant creatures, their presence carries significant risks. Among the most concerning is Lyme disease, a serious illness transmitted through the bite of infected ticks. Lyme disease can cause a range of symptoms, from fever and fatigue to severe neurological and cardiovascular issues if left untreated. This makes understanding and managing tick populations crucial for public health. Our comprehensive analysis delves into the environmental and biological factors contributing to the rise in tick numbers, aiming to uncover patterns and provide strategies to mitigate the risks associated with these persistent pests.

### Ticks, A Very Brief History
Ticks have their own quirky version of the circle of life, which might as well be called the "Cycle of Bites." Starting off as eggs laid by a tick mom who's ready to see the world, these tiny terrors hatch into larvae with a taste for small creatures. After their first meal, they morph into nymphs, which are basically teenage ticks with an insatiable hunger for larger hosts‚Äîthink bigger animals or unlucky humans. Once they‚Äôve had their fill, they finally grow up to become adult ticks, ready to party (read: feed) on the blood of their next unsuspecting victim. Rinse and repeat! It's like an endless buffet where the ticks are always the guests of honor, and we‚Äôre the main course. ü¶üüç¥

**Myth: Ticks Jump from Trees üå≥**
**Reality Check:**
***Contrary to the acrobatics you might imagine, ticks don‚Äôt jump, fly, or parachute down from trees like tiny ninjas. They generally hang out in grass and bushes, waiting to hitch a ride on unsuspecting passersby***

### The Data
For the analysis in this blog I used data from The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and The Centers for Disease Control (CDC). From NOAA this includes average yearly temperature and precipitation for each county from 2016-2022. From the CDC this was total number of Lyme disease (LD) cases for each county form the same time range. Each year was a separate .csv file that needed to be filtered and joined with the LD cases dataframe. Lets peak a some quick snapshots of what that looked like!

#### Import Neccessary Packages 
```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(here)
library(tidyverse)
library(janitor)
library(dplyr)
library(forecast)
```

#### Read in data
```{r}
# Temp data sets
temp_16 <- read_csv(here::here("data", "temp2016.csv"))
temp_17 <- read_csv(here::here("data", "temp2017.csv"))
temp_18 <- read_csv(here::here("data", "temp2018.csv"))
temp_19 <- read_csv(here::here("data", "temp2019.csv"))
temp_20 <- read_csv(here::here("data", "temp2020.csv"))
temp_21 <- read_csv(here::here("data", "temp2021.csv"))
temp_22 <- read_csv(here::here("data", "temp2022.csv"))

# Precipitation data sets
precip_16 <- read_csv(here::here("data", "precip2016.csv"))
precip_17 <- read_csv(here::here("data", "precip2017.csv"))
precip_18 <- read_csv(here::here("data", "precip2018.csv"))
precip_19 <- read_csv(here::here("data", "precip2019.csv"))
precip_20 <- read_csv(here::here("data", "precip2020.csv"))
precip_21 <- read_csv(here::here("data", "precip2021.csv"))
precip_22 <- read_csv(here::here("data", "precip2022.csv"))

# Lyme disease data sets
LD_data <- read_csv(here::here("data", "LD_Case_Counts_by_County_2022.csv"))
```

As you can see the data and temp data is serperated by year. The LD_data variable holds every single LD cases in the country over a 20 years span. We do not want thats so lets filter that one down. 

### Fire Data Exploration 
The dataset from California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection has over 22,000 fires between the years 1878 and 2023.
